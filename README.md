# PRS

## Intro
This project has been implemented by [Nikolay Cholakov](#contact) as part of the application process for a senior front-end developer position at [FriendsPlay](https://www.friendsplay.eu/).

## Prerequisites

This project requires the following tools to be installed on your system:

* To clone the `PRS` repository you will of course need [Git][git].
* To initialize and test `PRS` project you must have [Node.js][node] and its [package manager (npm)][npm] installed.
* To be able to run and generate Angular artifacts you will need [Angular CLI](angular-cli) npm package globally installed - otherwise you need to use npm's `npx` prefix at the begginig of every `ng` command listed below in order to use project's local version.

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply to:

* Clone the `PRS` repository;
* Install the `npm` dependencies.

### Clone `PRS` repository

Clone the `PRS` repository using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ch0k1/prs.git
cd prs
```

If you just want to start a new project without the `PRS` commit history then you can do:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ch0k1/prs.git <your-project-name>
```

The `depth=1` tells git to only pull down one commit worth of historical data.

### Install `PRS` dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project:
1. `devevelopment tools`;
2. `Angular` framework code.

We install them both via [npm][npm] by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

If the installation was successful, you should find out that you have a new directory in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need

## Code scaffolding

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.4.

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, `pipes` etc.), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
